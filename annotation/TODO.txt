- Bugs Open:
    > [ OK ] - Open parentheses not checking in expression.
    > [ TODO ] - Refactoring the BinaryOperation to build with correctly precedence.
    > [ TODO ] - Change BinaryOperation token to support use call function in your place:
               - When find call function in expression processing, set call function variable instead of BinaryOperation
               - then use GetByteCode() function of call function, making the process easy. 
    > [ TODO ] - Call function and return expression doesn't type check.
    > [ TODO ] - The parser let pass duplication variable declaration, in global and local scope.
    > [ TODO ] - traits in code generator of expression for process call functions.  the
