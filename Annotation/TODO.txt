	> [ OK ] 7 - Lexer: ignore empty and commented lines;
	> [ OK ] 8 - Parser: duplicate identifier validation and declaration;
	> [ OK ] 9 - Parser: Identify and accept others type value in assignment;
	> [ OK ] 10 - Parser: Check that arithmetic operation is the same as expected by the declarator;

	> [ OK ] 14 - Full: support to function declaration;
	> [ OK ] 15 - Full: support to assignment declaration;
	> [ OK ] 16 - Full: support to call function;
	> [ OK ] 17 - Full: support to conditions (if - OK, else - OK);

>> To Fix:

	> [ OK ] 1 - Fix the '=' delimiter recognized like the comparison;
	> [ OK ] 2 - Fix the single number, identifier or char has joinned to single word or number;
	> [ OK ] 3 - Function parameter does not recognize the others types.
	> [ OK ] 4 - Call function in expression does not throw the correct error message in syntax error.
	> [ OK ] 5 - Make call function validate the argument type.
		> [ OK ] 5.1 - Number type is ok, but, others type has problem yet.
	> [ OK ] 6 - the void function validating type return.
	> [ OK ] 7 - Do lexer ignore the commentary command where inside the string scope.
	> [ OK ] 8 - Check valid 'end' keyword.
	> [ TO DO ] 9 - Call function does not validate argument missing.
	> [ TO DO ] 10 - Function declaration does not accept declaration without the paramenters.
	> [ TO DO ] 11 - If you don't declare a variable on the first line, it won't compile.
