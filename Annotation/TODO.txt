>> To Fix:

	> [ OK ] 1 - Fix the '=' delimiter recognized like the comparison;
	> [ OK ] 2 - Fix the single number, identifier or char has joinned to single word or number;
	> [ OK ] 3 - Function parameter does not recognize the others types.
	> [ OK ] 4 - Call function in expression does not throw the correct error message in syntax error.
	> [ OK ] 5 - Make call function validate the argument type.
		> [ OK ] 5.1 - Number type is ok, but, others type has problem yet.
	> [ OK ] 6 - the void function validating type return.
	> [ OK ] 7 - Do lexer ignore the commentary command where inside the string scope.
	> [ TO DO ] 8 - Check valid 'end' keyword
